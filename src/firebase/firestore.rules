/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Marathi Digital Wedding Invitation Editor.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, ensuring that only the authenticated user who created an invitation and its associated schedule events can read, create, update, or delete them.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, establishing clear ownership. Invitations are stored in /users/{userId}/invitations/{invitationId}, and schedule events are stored in /users/{userId}/invitations/{invitationId}/scheduleEvents/{eventId}.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data. There are no shared resources or admin roles.
 * - List operations are restricted to the owner of the data.
 * - Data consistency between the path and the document's internal fields is enforced on creation and updates to prevent unauthorized access.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The userId is inherently part of the path for invitations and schedule events, eliminating the need for costly `get()` calls to determine ownership.
